    <h1>Pan Fried Onion Cheeseburger</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I make these burgers with caramelized onions and sharp Cheddar cheese. I serve them on brioche buns and eat them
        plain.</p>
    <h2>Ingredrients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef (80 percent lean)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 slices sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>3 rolls brioche, split and toasted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to Make</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place ground beef in a bowl and season with Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Mix thoroughly and shape
            into 3 balls. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet. Add onion and cook until onions start to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from
            the skillet. Add 3 ground beef balls to the same skillet and flatten with a cast iron press or a heavy
            spatula. Evenly top each patty with onions and cook for 3 to 4 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Carefully flip patties over so that the onions are now on the bottom, pressing once again with cast iron
            press or heavy spatula. Top each with a slice of cheese and cook until cheese is melted and burgers have
            reached the desired doneness, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve on brioche buns.</li>
    </ol>
